# Local-histogram-equalization

Histogram equalization is a widely used image contrast enhancement method. While global histogram equalization enhances the contrast of the whole image, local histogram equalization can enhance many image details by taking different transformation of the same gray level at different places in the original image.

The following resource is useful for understanding the theory of histogram equalization for discrete gray levels. https://www.math.uci.edu/icamp/courses/math77c/demos/hist_eq.pdf
